# Jumble

Take a jumbled series of letters and output any English words those letters could form.

NOTE: The possible acceptable words are in the file words_lowercase.txt, which is NOT
a comprehensive list of all English words. In particular, it contains very few
specialist domain words, although it does contain both American and British spellings
of many words (harbor vs. harbour, for example.)
